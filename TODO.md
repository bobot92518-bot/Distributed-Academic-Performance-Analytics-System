# TODO for Redoing PDF Bar Graph in Tab7

- [x] Increase figure size for the bar graph in PDF to improve readability
- [x] Adjust font sizes for title, axis labels, and ticks
- [x] Implement text wrapping for long subject names on y-axis
- [x] Limit the bar graph to top 20 subjects if there are more than 20 to avoid overcrowding
- [x] Improve legend position and styling
- [x] Ensure color contrast and distinctness for pass/fail bars
- [x] Test the PDF generation to verify improvements (changes made to add bar labels)
